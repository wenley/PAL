<h3>Planning Overview</h3>
<p>When constructing our initial ideal timeline for this project, planning was one
of the biggest areas of focus. As will be discussed below, we had to make a major
implementation switch part-way through the project from a website to a Chrome Extension,
which set us back a couple of weeks in terms of progress. At the time of the switch, we
set deadlines for finishing particular elements of our architecture and for the most part,
were able to meet those deadlines on time.
</p>

<p>Though our group was small, each of us had very different schedules, making
meeting on a frequent basis difficult. As a result, it was important to establish fixed
meeting times when we could re-group, discuss our progress, and set targets to meet
before the next meeting. We agreed to meet every Monday evening and Friday afternoon.
Even though Friday was the only day schedules aligned enough to meet with Yida, our
TA for the project, it ended up working out well because we would already be together
and could wrap up particular goals and think about future ones before going into the
meeting.
</p>

<p>As stated before, we each set ourselves specific parts of code to work on during
the week between meetings. When major milestones were reached, emails notified other
members to pull the changes off of GitHub so everyone could have the most recent
stable versions of the code. When faced with a seemingly-unsolvable bug, emails and
in-person meetings with other group members often provided the answer.
</p>

<p>One problem we encounctered was not correctly estimating how long a particular piece
of code would take to write and debug. Most of the time it wasn't a problem, but there
were a few times when it was getting too big and/or complicated for one person to handle.
At those points, we divided the work among multiple people and it ended up working out 
in time. If we hadn't set initial deadlines for all of our pieces of code, it would have
been less clear when a part was taking "too long" and needed additional resources to
get us to finsh on time.
</p>

<p>That all said, at the times of alpha and beta testing, we had met almost every milestone
and deadline we had set for ourselves. There were some element that lagged behind others
in progress, but overall, we were very happy with the pace at which we moved. The initial
planning and establishing an ideal timeline along with good communication allowed us to
do this.
</p>

<h3>Change of Project Implementation and Major Milestones</h3>

<p>On the whole, we were able to meet all of our milestones in a timely manner. One major
issue encountered soon after Spring Break
was a change in the implementation of PAL from a website independent of
Blackboard to a Chrome Extension. This change was necessary because a separate website would
not have had the correct permissions to mine the information on Blackboard and would have
introduced potential security issues with copy-righted materials and confidential information
such as student grades. A Chrome Extension, on the other hand, could piggy-back the browser's
authentication and could keep all its information local, solving both of these problems.
Just as an additional security measure, to avoid keeping a copy of confidential information,
 we didn't mine any potentially confidential information
such as E-Reserves, instead electing to present Blackboard's version of the page to the user
when asked. Upon this switch, we had to re-work our ideal timeline to deal with the fact that
two weeks' worth of effort went in a now-useless direction. Fortunately, we were able to
compensate for the loss in time by first establishing a solid backend mining process. In
retrospect, we really should have made talking with OIT our first priority, even before
diving into any implementation details such as learning Django; it would have saved us a
significant amount of effort and stress and just required a little more planning and
forethought.
</p>

<p>One thing we did not anticipate was that the true testing of the mining process only
happened once we had a rough UI in place and could see the results of our mining in a
readable manner. Previously, we attempted to verify mining by looking through Javascript
objects in the console or by doing a raw text dump to the webpage. Neither was actually
useful in verifying content, though they did verify that some mining took place and thus
the concept and architecture was correct. Once we found these bugs, we dealt with them
while we continued to develop the UI and other core features so that we wouldn't fall
behind in our schedule.
<p>

<h3> The Learning Curve </h3>

<p>The learning curve was quite steep for us in this project mainy due to the fact that
the change in implementation meant having to learn a whole other set of tools (i.e.
Javascript and Chrome's developer tools) on top of starting from scratch. We had spent
a fair amount of time over Spring Break learning to use Django and more Python, but when
we switched to making a Chrome Extension, all we ended up using was Javascript and CSS. As
mentioned above, the Console Developer Tool provided by Chrome was an immense help in the
early stages of the project when we were just fiddling around with Javascript to become
familiar with it. The project has been a huge learning experience for all of us since
none of us had ever worked extensively with Javascript before and it certainly isn't
the cleanest or nicest language to work with.
</p>

<o>Another extremely important experience was working with Blackboard. Our idea behind
this project was to make Blackboard more user-friendly, but while working on this, we
realized that Blackboard's HTML is incredibly difficult to work with from an outsider's
perspective. While Chrome and other browsers are forgiving of ill-formed HTML, the parsers
available to us did not have similar flexibility, which gave rise to some issues.
Unfortunately, we could not simply ignore this problem since PAL needed to reflect all
the content on Blackboard. Figuring how to deal with someone else's code was perhaps one
of the biggest learning experiences we had during the course of this project. (We also have
much more appreciation for well-formed HTML when we encounter it).
</p>

<h3> Important Resources </h3>

<p>One of the most important resources of help for us was other students who had been
through this class and/or were working on Chrome Extensions themselves. Emily Lancaster '12,
who built a Chrome Extension for her senior thesis was a huge help in understanding XML/HTML
and Javascript. When we thought we would build a website, we also initially spoke with
Michael Yaroshefsky '12 regarding getting whitelisted by CAS, but this ended up being unnecessary
once we switched to an Extension. The documentation provided by W3Schools was also useful, but
we found it to be relatively incomplete for our purposes given the host of resources provided by Chrome.
</p>

<h3> Strategies and Decisions </h3>

<p>One of the most important strategies our group used was to meet regularly and set goals at those
meetings for the next. This allowed us to work at a steady pace, keep up with our deadlines, and
prevent a build-up of issues and work. Another critical strategy was to reach out to others, both
within our group and to those outside of the group. When we switched to building a Chrome
Extension, we spoke with Professor Kernighan who put us in touch with students who could help with
our questions (i.e. Emily Lancaster!).
</p>

<p>In terms of project structure, working on the backend first, particularly the miner, right at
the beginning proved to be an important choice. This was the backbone and key functionality for
the entire project and was necessary before we could build any other significant features. The
issues we encountered during this stage of the project also informed us of what was possible in
the UI given the scope of information available to us. We also first worked on just the basic functions
of Blackboard (e.g. mining and displaying the commonly used tabs, Announcements, Course Materials,
and Assignments) and perfect those. We knew we would encounter more complicated problems when dealing
with more specialized features such as Tools and Submissions, but leaving them for when we were done
with the basics meant we had something to move forward with and we didn't bog ourselves down in
complicated messes.
</p>

<p>Our division of work between the back- and frontends of PAL allowed the members of the group to
specialize and work on similar and related pieces of code. This helped our productivity since it
meant we were rarely waiting for someone else to finish a piece of code; if we finished a goal
early, we could keep going and get ahead on other features before the next meeting. This also
made using CSS from the start very easy since only one member worked with it initially and thus
prevented too many fingers from stirring the CSS-pot.
</p>

<h3> Open Issues </h3>

<p>One of the issues we encountered with Blackboard was dealing with links to downloadable files.
Blackboard handles files in two different ways â€“ either opening up the file or link in a separate
window in Chrome or opening up a new page which starts the download process after a few seconds.
PAL currently has some difficulty handling the latter version since it wipes the original
Blackboard page clean before repainting, thereby stopping the download. We would like to explore
this issue to find a more efficient and consistent way of downloading files.
</p>

<p>Another issue we confronted was dealing with sensitive Blackboard information such as grades.
Currently, PAL opens the original BlackBoard grades page in an iFrame in the main element. It
would have been more intuitive if we could have changed the formatting of a Blackboard page as
widely used as "MyGrades", but scope and permissions issues prevented us from doing so.
</p>

<p>A third issue involves Blackboard's storage of documents. It appears that Blackboard uses some
sort of hash as part of the URL of uploaded documents. Unfortunately, this hash also appears to
change when something in that course is updated or even for seemingly no reason at all. This
caused our difference detection system to go haywire, but we dealt with it by not diff'ing the
links to documents.
</p>

<p>A fourth issue, though more peripheral, involves the quota on an extension's local storage
in Chrome. It appears that an extension has about 3, maybe 4 users' worth of information in
capacity. If this capacity is met, PAL will go into infinite mining loop.
We do not expect this to be a problem in practice since we expect the users of PAL to
have one copy per person/per computer/per browser instance.
</p>

<h3> Expansion </h3>
<p>We have several ideas for expansion, which mainly have to do with user-specific customization and personalization. We would like to make the color palette, as well as the title picture user-customizable, giving the user the option to either select a picture from a given list or upload a chosen picture. Our current CSS structure, with color separation, moreover, could allow for such a feature.</p>
<p>We would also like better integration of ICE and Piazza, especially ICE since it uses CAS login. We would like PAL to automatically login to ICE rather than the user having to go through the CAS login process again, which seems to be happening due to ICE attempting to store cookies locally and not getting them when we open it up inside of PAL. Currently, we have not found a way around this issue.</p>
<p>We would also like to continue improving the interface through user feedback, thereby assuring that we achieve our original motive of creating a highly intuitive and user-friendly interface for Blackboard.</p>

<h3> Concluding Thoughts and Remarks </h3>
<p>On the whole, we are quite happy with the way our project shaped up. We feel PAL accomplishes
its intended purpose, making Blackboard navigation easier for student, quite well. Though there
are features which were ultimately not accommodated either due to time or security issues, we feel
our interface is much more intuitive than the version Blackboard currently presents to student.
However, there are several issues that we feel we could have handled better, such as speaking
with OIT before Spring Break to fully understand the complications associated with our project,
as well as spending a little more time on the UI.</p>

<p>In terms of overall planning, we were pleased with our organization and meeting times,
as well the work structure. Working on the back end first and then moving to the front-end and
UI allowed and continues to allow us to change and customize the UI as necessary, with the
back-end, the base of our project, firmly in place. Moreover, this timeline allowed us to ensure
full intial functionality. While slightly better initial planning could have helped us avoid
the steep learning curve at the beginning of the project, consistently meeting our deadlines
throughout the rest of development helped assure everything worked out well in the end.</p>
