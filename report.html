<h3>Planning Overview</h3>
<p>When constructing our initial ideal timeline for this project, planning was one
of the biggest areas of focus. As will be discussed below, we had to make a major
implementation switch part-way through the project from a website to a Chrome Extension,
which set us back a couple of weeks in terms of progress. At the time of the switch, we
set deadlines for finishing particular elements of our architecture and for the most part,
were able to meet those deadlines on time.
</p>

<p>Though our group was small, each of us had very different schedules, making
meeting on a frequent basis difficult. As a result, it was important to establish fixed
meeting times when we could re-group, discuss our progress, and set targets to meet
before the next meeting. We agreed to meet every Monday evening and Friday afternoon.
Even though Friday was the only day schedules aligned enough to meet with Yida, our
TA for the project, it ended up working out well because we would already be together
and could wrap up particular goals and think about future ones before going into the
meeting.
</p>

<p>As stated before, we each set ourselves specific parts of code to work on during
the week between meetings. When major milestones were reached, emails notified other
members to pull the changes off of GitHub so everyone could have the most recent
stable versions of the code. When faced with a seemingly-unsolvable bug, emails and
in-person meetings with other group members often provided the answer.
</p>

<p>One problem we encounctered was not correctly estimating how long a particular piece
of code would take to write and debug. Most of the time it wasn't a problem, but there
were a few times when it was getting too big and/or complicated for one person to handle.
At those points, we divided the work among multiple people and it ended up working out 
in time. If we hadn't set initial deadlines for all of our pieces of code, it would have
been less clear when a part was taking "too long" and needed additional resources to
get us to finsh on time.
</p>

<p>That all said, at the times of alpha and beta testing, we had met almost every milestone
and deadline we had set for ourselves. There were some element that lagged behind others
in progress, but overall, we were very happy with the pace at which we moved. The initial
planning and establishing an ideal timeline along with good communication allowed us to
do this.
</p>

<h3>Change of Project Implementation and Major Milestones</h3>

<p>On the whole, we were able to meet all of our milestones in a timely manner. One major
issue encountered soon after Spring Break
was a change in the implementation of PAL from a website independent of
Blackboard to a Chrome Extension. This change was necessary because a separate website would
not have had the correct permissions to mine the information on Blackboard and would have
introduced potential security issues with copy-righted materials and confidential information
such as student grades. A Chrome Extension, on the other hand, could piggy-back the browser's
authentication and could keep all its information local, solving both of these problems.
Just as an additional security measure, to avoid keeping a copy of confidential information,
 we didn't mine any potentially confidential information
such as E-Reserves, instead electing to present Blackboard's version of the page to the user
when asked. Upon this switch, we had to re-work our ideal timeline to deal with the fact that
two weeks' worth of effort went in a now-useless direction. Fortunately, we were able to
compensate for the loss in time by first establishing a solid backend mining process.
</p>

<p>One thing we did not anticipate was that the true testing of the mining process only
happened once we had a rough UI in place and could see the results of our mining in a
readable manner. Previously, we attempted to verify mining by looking through Javascript
objects in the console or by doing a raw text dump to the webpage. Neither was actually
useful in verifying content, though they did verify that some mining took place and thus
the concept and architecture was correct. Once we found these bugs, we dealt with them
while we continued to develop the UI and other core features so that we wouldn't fall
behind in our schedule.
<p>

<h3> The Learning Curve </h3>

<p>The learning curve was quite steep for us in this project mainy due to the fact that
the change in implementation meant having to learn a whole other set of tools (i.e.
Javascript and Chrome's developer tools) on top of starting from scratch. We had spent
a fair amount of time over Spring Break learning to use Django and more Python, but when
we switched to making a Chrome Extension, all we ended up using was Javascript and CSS. As
mentioned above, the Console Developer Tool provided by Chrome was an immense help in the
early stages of the project when we were just fiddling around with Javascript to become
familiar with it. The project has been a huge learning experience for all of us since
none of us had ever worked extensively with Javascript before and it certainly isn't
the cleanest or nicest language to work with.
</p>

<o>Another extremely important experience was working with Blackboard. Our idea behind
this project was to make Blackboard more user-friendly, but while working on this, we
realized that Blackboard's HTML is incredibly difficult to work with from an outsider's
perspective. While Chrome and other browsers are forgiving of ill-formed HTML, the parsers
available to us did not have similar flexibility, which gave rise to some issues.
Unfortunately, we could not simply ignore this problem since
