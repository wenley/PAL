<h3>PAL: Princeton Academic Linker</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important academic tools at Princeton is Blackboard. It provides students a number of different ways to get information about their courses, and also facilitates interaction between professors and their class. However, while Blackboard has these features, they are poorly presented to the user, thus making for a frustrating online experience.
Also, the Princeton academic experience online today has a number of other tools tied into it. Students also use the Integrated Course Engine (ICE), to select classes and coordinate with friends about them, and Piazza, which many classes use as an online discussion forum. Students also use a separate website called SCORE to sign up for courses.
</p>
<p>In an increasingly interconnected world, and rising stress levels for students at Princeton, it becomes important to easily access their course information online. Thus, we present PAL – Princeton Academic Linker, your friend through your online academic experience at Princeton.  PAL not only makes the frustrating Blackboard interface user friendly and easy to navigate, it also connects users with their other online academic tools – ICE, Score and Pizza.</p>

<h3>The Story of Mo</h3>

<h2><b>The Blackboard Frustrations</b><h2>
<p>Meet Mo. Mo is a high achieving Princeton student, who has no time to deal with unnecessary delays because of bad user interfaces. Let us meet Mo on the day before her ENG 385: Children’s Literature final exam. Mo is frantically looking for her notes to finish last minute reading and study. She obviously logs on to Blackboard to find her readings. </p>
