The most widely used academic tool on campus is probably Blackboard. While Blackboard has a host of good features, they're badly presented to the user, creating an overall frustrating experience. We seek to fix this through PAL, the Princeton Academic Linker. 
Imagine logging onto a system which displays tabs of all of your current courses, where the main page for each course is not an oft-blank "announcements" page, but rather an array of widgets you need, from Course Materials to Assignments. Imagine not having to mine through numerous links with irrelevant sections to finally find your class blog, but rather having the tools you use most frequently readily available. Imagine any new postings by your professor available in digest form, so that you can automatically link to your new problem set. PAL makes all of this possible, and more.
