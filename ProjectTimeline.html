</font>
<font size="2" face="helvetica">
  Met to discuss the architectural design of the project,and to write the Project Overview Document. We downloaded the necessary software, thus passing our milestone of all having appropriate environments. We made and sent out a survey for faculty in order to obtain data on Blackboard application usage. Discussed issues in the main implementation.

  Met with Kevin Perry and Dennis Hood. Realized original model of information flow was not feasible due to the lack of proper credientials for the Miner. We decided to switch to writing a Chrome Extension with the same functionality: representing the information on Blackboard to a student user in a nicer format. We beta-tested simulating user actions in javascript through a primitive extension. Unfortunately, we ran into problems getting XMLHttpRequest to work.

  Met with Emily Lancaster, with whom we made the tragic discovery that Blackboard has ill-formed XML/HTML pages that sometimes don't close tags. Given this, we decided to skip XML parsing and just use regular expressions to extract information from Blackboard pages.
