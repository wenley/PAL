<P> The elevator speech description goes here.
<P> Princeton Academic Linker (PAL) repaints the user interface for Blackboard, 
one of the most important academic tools at Princeton, making it intuitive
and user-friendly, and also linking it with other student academic tools such
as Integrated Course Engine, Piazza and Score. </P>

<P> How to access or create a running version of your system.
If your system is web-based, this should be a URL.
If your system is stand-alone on some public or private machine, we
need to be able to access it on that machine.  
If your system is a PC application,
this should reference a .EXE file or equivalent installable version.
Don't forget passwords, including administrative access, if we will need them.

<P> If something goes wrong, who you do call? Ghostbusters! (Actually, Wenley Tong)
