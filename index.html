<P> The elevator speech description goes here.
<P> Princeton Academic Linker (PAL) repaints the user interface for Blackboard, 
one of the most important academic tools at Princeton, making it intuitive
and user-friendly, and also linking it with other student academic tools such
as Integrated Course Engine, Piazza and Score. </P>

<P> How to access PAL:
<ol><li>Open Chrome
<li>Using Chrome, visit <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wenleyt/PAL.crx">this link</a>. PAL should
automatically begin downloading. When it asks to add PAL, click "Add".
<li>Visit <a href="https://blackboard.princeton.edu/">Blackboard</a>. If the page is orange, PAL
loaded successfully.
<li>Log in to Blackboard.
<li>PAL should give a "Loading . . . . ." message. This will take about 1 minute to initialize
PAL. PAL will restart itself once it's finished initializing.
<li>Enjoy!
</ol>

<P> If something goes wrong, who you do call? Ghostbusters! (Actually, Wenley Tong)
